    "\n",
    "<!-- For our immediate purposes, the coverage is our first rating variable. Other things being equal, we would expect that policyholders with larger coverage have larger claims. We will make this vague idea much more precise as we proceed, and also justify this expectation with data. -->\n",

    "**Variable**  | **Description**\n",
